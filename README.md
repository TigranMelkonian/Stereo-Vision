  Stereo matching, the extraction of depth information from digital images, is one of the most heavily investigated topics in computer vision with many applications in entertainment, object recognition,information transfer, and automated systems. In this project, we want to implement a stereo matching algorithm. The baseline approach is through the traditional block matching algorithm. Our goal is to explore an improved method for detecting objects in stereo images and calculating a more accurate correspondence between two images. We plan on initially utilizing the middlebury dataset, of two-frame stereo images, because it provides us high quality ground truth images and calibration data. Additionally, we plan on exploring filtering methods for both de-noising and hole-filling in depth maps. To challenge ourselves, we want to extend the algorithm to non-parallel camera settings for example the bats over the lake.
